C - printf (Group Project)
  by Hector and Christian.


---Project Description---

We are creating a program that can print out different types of information by the user.
Currently, we are going to focus on the most common ones for how to print; whole numbers, single
characters, string of characters, numbers with decimal points, and unsigned numbers.


          -----Intention of functions for Format Specifiers-----

1) Being able to print a 'int' (%d).

2) Being able to print a 'int' (%i).

3) Being able to print a 'char' (%c).

4) Being able to print a 'char []' (%s).

5) Being able to print a 'percent sign' (%).



          -----Function prototype stored in our header file-----

int _printf(const char *format, ...); /*For our main file.*/
