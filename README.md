C - printf (Group Project)
  by Hector and Christian.


---Project Description---

We are creating a program that can print out different types of information by the user.
Currently, we are going to focus on the most common ones for how to print; whole numbers, single
characters, string of characters, numbers with decimal points, and unsigned numbers.


          -----Intention of functions for Format Specifiers-----

1) Being able to print a 'int' (%d).

2) Being able to print a 'char' (%c).

3) Being able to print a 'char []' (%s).

4) Being able to print a 'float' (%f).

5) Being able to print a 'unsigned int' (%u).



          -----Function prototype stored in our header file-----

int _printf(const char *format, ...); /*For our main file.*/
